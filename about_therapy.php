  <h1>Choosing Therapy: Overcoming Depression, Anxiety, Addictions</h1>
  <p>
  Why do people decide to seek out therapy?  Many people have recognized the
  need for change in their lives, but don't know how to take the appropriate steps to make the changes. Often
  they have consulted with family and friends for their advice, but
  still haven't been able to move forward. Perhaps they are more private
  with their personal struggles and want to seek help from a neutral professional. </p>
  <p>
  My goal is to help you figure out what's holding you back, and what can aid you in
  gaining the happiness that comes from living the life you choose.  
  </p>
  <p>
  <a href="specializations.php">Depression, anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder, and many other conditions</a> are very painful. I have helped a lot of people, and  I can help you too.  I can also help your partner and family if needed.  
  </p>
  <p>
  I offer a brief "getting to know you session", so you can ascertain your
  comfort level with me, and with my office location and ambiance.
