    My office is located conveniently in the heart of Chapel Hill, less than a half mile from the intersection of Franklin Street and Elliot Road.  Coming from downtown Chapel Hill, take a left on Elliot Rd. and proceed to the first stop sign, which will be Old Oxford Rd.  Take a right on Old Oxford and follow it until it comes to a "T-intersection" at Oxford Hill Dr.  Take a right at the "T" and my office is located in the first home on the right, at 213 Oxford Hills Dr.</p>
