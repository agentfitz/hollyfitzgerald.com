<i>Addiction appears to be a major factor in your daily life.</i><br /><br />For women and men of all ages, regardless of the drugs, studies have shown that treatment works when it is structured, flexible, sufficiently long, and integrated with other forms of rehabilitation. Drug addiction was once viewed exclusively as a moral problem or character defect. Today, we understand it to be a chronic, recurring illness with personal and social underpinnings. Drug addiction produces changes in brain chemistry, but treatment can help restore chemical balance and give patients a chance to regain control of their lives. In conjunction with treatment, addicts need job training, relapse prevention, supervision, psychological support, and medication where indicated. Equally important are aftercare transitional treatment, self-help groups, and community support.
