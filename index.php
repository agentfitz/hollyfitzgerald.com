 <h1>How can I help you?</h1>
 <p>
  My goal is to help you address your issues that you feel are standing in the way of your leading a more fulfilling life.  Below you will find excerpts from my Blog "Steps to Serenity - Tips from a Therapist,"
  which offers a collection of thoughts I have gained from helping patients improve their lives for over 25 years.
  Is there a particular topic you would like to see addressed?  I invite you to read the entries and share your thoughts in the comments, or <a href="contact.php">contact me</a> directly for a getting to know each other session.

You learn that it's okay to feels what you feel, okay to ask for what you need, okay to want what you want, etc. All this self awareness goes with an awareness of the right of others to honor themselves as well. Thus is the challenge of learning healthy boundaries in relationship with others.
