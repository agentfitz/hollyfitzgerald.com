  <h1>Holly FitzGerald Insurance Information</h1>
  <p>
  <p>
    I file all insurance claims electronically, and will accept co-pays from you once your annual deductible is paid.  Until your deductible is paid, I will ask you to pay me the full amount, unless we have made prior arrangements. You may pay by check or cash.  I don't accept credit cards for payment. I will discuss a sliding scale if needed. You may call me on the phone if you need help between sessions. I'll call you back when I'm available. I add the time up that we spend on the phone, and bill it as a session when we reach 50 minutes.</p><br />
<p><strong>I am a directly enrolled preferred provider for:</strong></p>
<h2>Medicare</h2>
<p style="postion: relative; top: -20px;">
Medicare pays half of their approved fee of $71.20.  This is called the "psychiatric reduction".  The rest is the responsibility of the patient. Many secondary insurance companies cover the remaining amount, like AARP or State Health BCBS.</p>
<h2>Medicaid</h2>
<h3>Medicaid/ Children</h3>
<p>
Medicaid usually pays the entire amount for children. Children are allowed 26 sessions per calendar year, and more can be requested if needed.
</p>
<h3>Medicaid / Adults</h3>
<p>
Adults are allowed 8 session per calendar year, and more can be requested if needed. Medicaid usually pays most of the billed amount for adults. The fee per 50 minute session is $68.57. Your co-pay is based on your income, but the patient co-pay portion is usually very small. Please check with Medicaid to find out if you have any co-pay.
</p>
<h2>BCBS</h2>
<p>BCBS pays differing amounts dependent on your policy and your employer. If you are out of state BCBS you will be covered like an in state person. I am a participating provider for Federal BCBS, State Health, Blue Advantage, Blue Options, and Costwise.
</p>
<h2>CIGNA</h2>
<p>
Cigna requires different co-pays based on your employer's agreement with them. Please check your individual policy. 
</p>
<h2>Other Insurance Companies</h2>
<p>
Please check with your insurance to see if you are covered with me. I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. Often I am covered as an "out of network" option,
and your co-pay could be higher. Please also check the number of sessions that are allowed.
