  <h1>Specializations including Depression, Anxiety, <acronym title="Post Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</acronym></h1>
  <p>
  I am a broad range clinician and, in addition to talking through your issues, I can introduce you to relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, muscle relaxation and guided meditation. I can also help you heal past relationships from deep within, and help guide you through working with your inner child if needed. If desired, I can do spiritual work with you designed to help sort out what is religious and what is spiritual, and help you bring what you need into your life.  
  
  </p>
  <p>When needed, I refer you to a psychiatrist for medication to augment our work together.

  <h2>Depression</h2>
  <p>If you are experiencing problems sleeping, feeling hopeless and/or helpless, not finding pleasure in things that brought you pleasure before, you may be experiencing depression. I can help you identify the areas in your life that foster depression, and problem solve to make necessary changes.</p>
  <h2>Anxiety</h2>
  <p>If you are feeling fearful, with or without understandable reasons, if you have panic attacks, with shortness of breath and racing heartbeat, and can't shake it off, if you feel disabled by dread of everyday situations, you have anxiety. There are many techniques to help you cope with and allievate anxiety.</p>
  <h2>Post Traumatic Stress</h2>
  <p>If you have recurring visions of fearful and traumatic incidents in your life, over and over, awake or asleep, and can't move past them, you are experiencing Post Traumatic Stress.  There are techniques you can learn that will help you to improve your quality of life.
  </p>
  <h2>Addictions</h2>
  <p> If you have a habit or behavior such as drinking, drug use or gambling that dominates your daily life, and that you find yourself powerless to stop despite promising to do so, then it is very likely that you are addicted. A definition of addiction that I use is the continued use of a substance or behavior, regardless of the negative consequences in your life.  With my help, you can become aware of all the factors involved in your choices so you can make the decisions that empower you for your life.</p>
  <h2>Family and Couple</h2>
  <p>Relationships are difficult, but they are much more difficult if you don't know the "rules" of healthy interaction.  If the relationships that were modeled for you were unhealthy, where would you have learned what a healthy relationship looks like?  I can teach you many communication skills and tools that will help you develop and maintain the relationships you desire.
</p>
  <h2>Aging</h2>
  <p>It is said that "growing old is not for sissies".  There is humor and truth here.  There are resources for the aging
population that you, or your caregivers, need to know. There are also coping skills to learn that will help you pass through these transitions.</p>
