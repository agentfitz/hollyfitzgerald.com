  <h1>Chapel Hill Therapy in a Comfortable Setting</h1>
  <p>
  Thank you for visiting my site.  My name is Holly FitzGerald, and I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (<acronym title="Licensed Clinical Social Worker">LCSW</acronym>). I expect you are here because you are looking for a therapist for yourself or a loved one.
  </p>
  <p>
  As a Clinical Social Worker, I have been in private practice in Chapel Hill since 1989, and worked with various social service agencies since 1971.  I have worked with, and continue to work with a broad range of populations, from children to the aging.  I work with individuals, couples and families, of any orientation and combination.  Help with childhood difficulties, pre-marital counseling, end of life counseling and help with life changes along the way are all part of my expertise.

  <h1>Providing a safe environment for healing and change</h1>
  <p>Your comfort is important to me so I have a home office with very comfortable furniture, and a good view of my garden.  When you arrive for a session, I will I ask you to remove your shoes and offer you a beverage. Water, tea, and coffee are always available.  A small amount of paperwork will get us started, along with a copy of my <acronym title="Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act">HIPAA</acronym> privacy practices for you to review and take home with you. I will be copying your insurance card, if you have one, while you are filling out the paperwork.  I take notes during our session.</p>
  <p>At the end of our session, we will schedule our next appointment, which I will write down for you on a business card.  If you like, you may borrow a book from my lending library that is pertinent to your issue; I have several to lend. I welcome questions and comments. <a href="contact.cfm" title="Contact Holly FitzGerald">Please feel free to call or send an email.</a></p>
  <p>Thank you, and I look forward to working together.</p>
